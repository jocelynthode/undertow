/**
 * The security handler responsible for attaching the SecurityContextImpl to the current {@link HttpServerExchange}.
 *
 * This handler is called early in the processing of the incoming request, subsequently supported authentication mechanisms will
 * be added to the context, a decision will then be made if authentication is required or optional and the associated mechanisms
 * will be called.
 *
 * If any existing {@link SecurityContextImpl} has been set it will be replaced and then restored as the the
 * {@link HttpCompletionHandler} is called, this allows for a general security configuration to be applied to a server and then
 * replaced with a context specific config.
 *
 * In addition to the HTTPExchange authentication state can also be associated with the {@link HttpServerConnection} and with
 * the {@link Session} however this is mechanism specific so it is down to the actual mechanisms to decide if there is state
 * that can be re-used.
