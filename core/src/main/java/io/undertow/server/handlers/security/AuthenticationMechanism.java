/**
 * The interface to be implemented by a single authentication mechanism.
 *
 * The implementation of this interface are assumed to be stateless, if there is a need to share state between the authenticate
 * and handleComplete calls then it should be held in the HttpServerExchange.
 *
 * As an in-bound request is received the authenticate method is called on each mechanism in turn until one of the following
 * occurs: -
 *   - A mechanism successfully authenticates the incoming request.
 *   - A mechanism attempts but fails to authenticate the request.
 *   - The list of mechanisms is exhausted.
 *
 * This means that if the authenticate method is called on a mechanism it should assume it is required to check if it can actually
 * authenticate the incoming request, anything that would prevent it from performing the check would have already stopped the authenticate
 * method from being called.
 *
 * Authentication is allowed to proceed if either authentication was required AND one handler authenticated the request or it is
 * allowed to proceed if it is not required AND no handler failed to authenticate the request.
 *
 * The handleComplete methods are used as the request processing is returning up the chain, primarily these are used to
 * challenge the client to authenticate but where supported by the mechanism they could also be used to send mechanism specific
 * updates back with a request.
 *
 * If a mechanism successfully authenticated the incoming request then only the handleComplete method on that mechanism is
 * called.
 *
 * If any mechanism failed or if authentication was required and no mechanism succeeded in authenticating the request then
 * handleComplete will be called for all mechanisms.
 *
 * Finally if authentication was not required handleComplete will not be called for any of the mechanisms.
 *
 * The mechanisms will need to double check why handleComplete is being called, if the request was authenticated then they should
 * do nothing unless the mechanism has intermediate state to send back.  If the request was not authenticated then a challenge should
 * be sent.
